Create a template monorepo for a for a vite+react front, with a fastAPI backend utilizing sqlalchemy, and Postgres for a database, and Traefik Proxy. I want a docker compose config that supports local dev with hot reload and one for a production build.

The local development does not requirement Traefik only the server build does.

For the fastapi backend it must be using pydantic. It should also pytest and Hypothesis for testing.

The vite+react frontend must support mobile devices. The starting point for the monorepo is to have a landing page that supports registration and signin for google and apple as well as magiklink via email.

For local development it should support hot reloading.

For production it should build images that can be uploaded to ghcr.io

pnpm should be used

Both the frontend and backend should support a build-info file that is created as part of the build process. This will include the version, build number, git info, test or prod.

FastApi should be using openapi and should generate typescript types for the frontend to use.

For the backend it must be using mypy and all changes should be verified by mypy.
The functions in the python backend must use pydantic types .
